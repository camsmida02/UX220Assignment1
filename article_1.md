# Financial
A couple financial goals I have for myself in 5 years is too focus on saving money and being more economical with purchases. I want to create a large enough saving where I can support myself for a good amount of time. In also would like to set a spending goal where I can minimize unnecessary purchases such as eating takeout instead of purchasing ingredients from the store to cook a nice meal at home at a cheaper cost.
