# Contrasting Research
The academic article I have chosen is "Student perspectives on competency-based portfolios: Does a portfolio reflect their competence development?". This study aims to reflect on how students choose goals and the affect on competence development. Applying this to my goals I noticed that just writing my goals down is a step in the write direction according to these scholars. After reading this article one thing I would change about my goal setting is that I should be more exploratory and talk with a mentor on creating goals with substance.
